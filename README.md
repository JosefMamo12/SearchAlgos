# SearchAlgos
## Project Description
Visualization of search algorithms:
* BFS
* RECURSIVE DFID
* A*
* IDA*
* DFBnB



## The Game   
I will demonstrate the use of the above algorithms by using game.

### Game Input
 We get an input from external file the algorithm that we would like to use board in size of 3X3 or 5X5
 initial state and goal state like this

### Game Rules
* One move create a new state
* 3X3 Board contains: 2 Red, 2 Blue and 2 Green boxes.
* 5X5 Board contains: 4 Yellow, 4 Red, 4 Blue and 4 Green boxes.
* Every move of  a color cost different price.
  * Yellow & Red cost 1 
  * Blue cost 2
  * Green cost 10
